## Promises
Webcomponents very promising, future is bright, birds are soaring, sheeps are jumping
* it's superfast (compered to react, so little layering)
* lit.dev leverages web standart webcomponents
* builds gets %98 of lighthouse (react page gets %68)  

## No never
css is used to use make styleing consistent through website
*  you cant apply every style to down to element ( you dont have time )
*  you cant understand if code applies, you just feel/see 
*  they cant provide working example ( cause it would be dissestar )
*  for one whole day I cant pass through nav/hero
